# gulp-workflow

npm install -- all other commands are in the gulpfile :)

Setup notes
*Clone workflow repo into new site folder
*setup new repo on git hub, no need for readme as one is included
*cd into website folder
*git remote set-url origin address-of-the-repo
*git remote -v to verify
*git remote add upstream address-of-the-repo
*git push origin master -- (may get an error -- if so just git status as you probably need to commit some changes first).
*git push --all to confirm
*npm install
*gulp or gulp watch to start the server
